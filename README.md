# Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project is a culmination of my journey as a Full Stack Developer, designed to present a comprehensive overview of my professional and technical skills, academic background, work experience, and key projects. The site is built using Next.js, a powerful React framework, and styled with Tailwind CSS to ensure a modern, clean, and responsive design. 

To enhance the visual appeal and user interaction, I've integrated Framer Motion, an advanced animation library, which brings the website to life with smooth and engaging animations. Whether you're browsing through my skills, learning about my educational background, exploring my professional experiences, or reviewing the projects I've worked on, you'll find a seamless and immersive experience.

One of the standout features of this portfolio website is the availability of both light and dark modes. This ensures that you can switch between themes based on your preference and environment, making it comfortable to navigate at any time of the day. Each section of the website is meticulously crafted to provide a detailed and structured view of my journey, making it easy for potential employers, collaborators, and peers to understand my capabilities and get in touch with me effortlessly.
